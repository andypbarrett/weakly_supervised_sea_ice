This Quarto Book provides background and resources for the NSF Funded Collaborations in Artificial Intelligence and Geosciences (CAIG) project Weakly Supervised Learning to Address Label-Data Irregularities in Sea-Ice Classification.  This is a three year collaboration between University of Colorado Denver Computer Science and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).

The introduction provides an overview of the project.  The Data section provides a description of the data used in the project.  The Methods section describes our approaches to the problem.
